    The Quuu API for PHP based applications
</p>

# Installation
The Quuu API requires the use of Composer package manager and at least PHP 7.1 in order to work correctly. These requirements may change down the line so please ensure all software you wish to use Quuu with is up-to-date utilising the most modern stable version of software possible.

Whilst the Quuu API can work with a Base PHP installation, It is compatible with frameworks such as Laravel & Symfony.

To install the Quuu API PHP Client, run the following command at your project's root
```
composer require quuulimited/api-php
```
This will install the client as well as any required composer packages.

You will then be able to import the API client into your controllers / scripts via use of
```
use Quuu\QuuuClient;
```

Once installed, you should authenticate to the API as all requests that are made to the Quuu API should be authenticated utilising any key-pairs provided to you by Quuu Ltd.
